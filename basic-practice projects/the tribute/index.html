          <h2>Iron Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel </b>(Gujarati: [ʋəlːəbʱ.bʱɑi
            dʒʱəʋeɾbʱɑi pəʈel]; Vallabhbhāī Jhāverbhāī Paṭel; 31 October 1875
            – 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai
            Patel,[a] was an Indian independence activist and statesman who
            served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of
            India from 1947 to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian
            National Congress, who played a significant role in the Indian
            independence movement and India's political integration.[1] In
            India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief"
            in Hindustani, Bengali, Persian and Prakrit. He acted as the Home
            Minister during the political integration of India and the
            Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[2] Patel was born in Nadiad city at
            Bombay Presidency (present-day Kheda district, Gujarat) and raised
            in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.[3] He was a successful
            lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he
            organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in
            non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming
            one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed
            as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. Under the
            chairmanship of Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy"
            resolution was passed by the Congress.
